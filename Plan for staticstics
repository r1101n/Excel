Day 1: Statistics and Probability Basics
Morning: Build Statistical Intuition
Learn descriptive statistics:
Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
Frequency distributions and histograms
Understand probability:
Basic probability rules
Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
Key distributions: Normal, Binomial, and Poisson
Afternoon: Inferential Statistics
Learn sampling methods and the Central Limit Theorem.
Understand hypothesis testing:
p-values, Type I & Type II errors
Perform basic tests (z-test, t-test)
Explore correlation and regression:
Linear regression (simple and multiple)
R-squared and model assumptions
Evening: Hands-On Practice
Use Python or R to practice:
Visualizing data with libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or ggplot2
Running simple statistical tests using scipy.stats or statsmodels
Day 2: Machine Learning Basics
Morning: Introduction to Machine Learning
Learn supervised learning:
Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Understand unsupervised learning:
Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
Afternoon: Key Machine Learning Concepts
Learn about:
Train-test split
Cross-validation
Overfitting and underfitting
Study evaluation metrics:
Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Regression: Mean Squared Error, R-squared
Evening: Hands-On Practice
Build simple ML models using scikit-learn or caret:
Train and evaluate a linear regression model.
Perform classification using logistic regression.
Visualize results using Python/R.
Day 3: Data Wrangling, Visualization, and Deployment
Morning: Data Wrangling
Learn to clean and preprocess data:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling and normalization
Work with libraries like pandas (Python) or dplyr (R).
Afternoon: Data Visualization
Create impactful visualizations:
Explore matplotlib, seaborn, or ggplot2
Learn to design dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau
Focus on storytelling with data.
Evening: Deploy a Mini Project
Choose a simple dataset (e.g., Kaggle’s Titanic dataset).
Build an end-to-end pipeline:
Data cleaning and exploration
Model building and evaluation
Visualize insights in a Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown.
Optionally, deploy the model using Flask, Streamlit, or Shiny.
Key Tips:
Focus on practice: Learning happens faster when you apply concepts.
Use ready resources: Utilize platforms like Kaggle, Google Colab, or RStudio for real-world datasets and coding environments.
Be consistent: While this roadmap is an intense crash course, follow up with sustained learning over time to truly master data science.
By the end of Day 3, you’ll have a strong foundation and a practical project to showcase your understanding.
